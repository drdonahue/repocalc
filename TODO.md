# Bugs

No bugs are currently known, for better or worse. They will be added here as they are uncovered.

# To Do

Prepare everything for the 1.0.0 release. This will mean shoring up and cleaning up anything
that could use a redesign, and ensuring that the current interfaces are ready to freeze.
once 1.0.0 is pushed out, the interfaces will not be able to change unless a major overhaul
becomes neccesary for some reason. All 1.x.x versions must have the same interfaces for customization.
